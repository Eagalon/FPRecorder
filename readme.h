It's called Loopback.\r\n\r\nKey Features :\r\n{\r\n\t-Supports configuration files, enabling you to customize various settings for FPRecorder.\r\n\t- Recording from two devices. Microphone, and loopback.\r\n\t- Fast and portable. FPRecorder is written in the compilable programming language C++, which makes it compact and fast.\r\n\t- Convenient and accessible interface. FPRecorder's GUI is also available for people using screen readers.\r\n\t- Adding hotkeys. Add global hotkeys to actions such as record, stop, pause. You can use them outside the FPRecorder window.\r\n}\r\n\r\nWhat I need for FPRecorder?\r\nWindows 10 64 bit and a sound card.\r\nGetting started:\r\nYou are now in the about program window. To close this window, press Enter or the \"Start using FPRecorder\" button.\r\nTo simply start recording, open the main program window and click the \"Start recording\" button. By default, the input device selected in the system will be used while recording, but you can select it in the \"Input devices\" list.\r\nAlso, to use the Loopback feature, you must select the device in the \"Output loopback devices\" list.\r\nNow, when you clicked on the record button, your selected devices will be used.\r\nDuring recording, you can stop, pause or restart recording. When you restart recording, all previously recorded data will be lost, so if you press the restart button carelessly, FPRecorder will warn you about this.\r\nAfter recordingwill be stopped, you can either open the \"recordings\" folder (It will be located in the same folder where you have FPRecorder executable), or listen to the recording directly from the application by clicking on the \"Recordings manager\" button.\r\nLet's use the recordings manager to listen your recorded audio!\r\nIn the main program window, you can find the \"Recordings manager\" button. This is what you need now.\r\nWhen you click on the manager button, a list of audio files will open, with buttons such as play, pause, stop and delete. \r\nEither you can use the \"Play\" button to play the file, or simply press Space.\r\nTo close the Recordings Manager window, either press Escape or the \"Close\" button.\r\nBut if you want to customize the recording settings, you must edit the program configuration, which is also located in the folder with FPRecorder. Of course, I will definitely make the settings in the future, but now you can open the \"fp.ini\" file and start editing it.\r\nTo edit this configuration file, close the program, find the file \"fp.ini\", which should be in the folder with FPRecorder. If it is not exists, try running the program again.\r\n";
